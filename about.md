I study coral epigenetics in the [Roberts Lab](https://faculty.washington.edu/sr320/) 
at the [University of Washington's School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences](https://fish.uw.edu/). The primary purpose of this site is to host my [lab notebook](https://jldimond.github.io/). Currently, notebook posts through September 2016 can be found at [my old notebook](http://onsnetwork.org/jdimond/). 

My background is primarily in the biology and ecology of symbiotic cnidarians, organisms such as sea anemones and corals that live in shallow waters and rely on nutritional contributions from  algal symbionts. In the Roberts Lab, my PhD work evaluates the role of the epigenetic process known as DNA methylation in coral phenotypic plasticity and response to environmental change.
